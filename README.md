> Transform your development workflow from manual command chains to automated expert teams with 95% quality assurance.

## 🚀 From Manual Commands to Automated Workflows

**Before**: Manual command chains requiring constant oversight
```bash
/ask → /code → /test → /review → /optimize
# 1-2 hours of manual orchestration, context pollution, quality uncertainty
```

**After**: One-command automated expert workflows
```bash
/requirements-pilot "Implement JWT user authentication system"
# 30 minutes of automated execution, 90% quality gates, zero manual intervention
```

## 🎯 Core Value Proposition

This repository provides a **meta-framework for Claude Code** that implements:

- **🤖 Multi-Agent Orchestration**: Specialized AI teams working in parallel
- **⚡ Quality Gate Automation**: 95% threshold with automatic optimization loops  
- **🔄 Workflow Automation**: From requirements to production-ready code
- **📊 Context Isolation**: Each agent maintains focused expertise without pollution

## 📋 Two Primary Usage Patterns

### 1. 🏭 Requirements-Driven Workflow (Automated Expert Teams)

**Architecture**: Requirements-focused workflow with quality gates
```
requirements-generate → requirements-code → requirements-review → (≥90%?) → requirements-testing
         ↑                                              ↓ (<90%)
         ←←←←←← Automatic optimization loop ←←←←←←
```

**Usage**:
```bash
# Complete development workflow in one command
/requirements-pilot "Build user management system with RBAC"

# Advanced multi-stage workflow
First use requirements-generate, then requirements-code, then requirements-review, 
then if score ≥90% use requirements-testing
```

**Quality Scoring** (Total 100%):
- Functionality (40%)
- Integration (25%) 
- Code Quality (20%)
- Performance (15%)

### 2. 🎛️ Custom Commands (Manual Orchestration)

**Architecture**: Individual slash commands for targeted expertise
```bash
/ask     # Technical consultation and architecture guidance
/spec    # Interactive requirements → design → tasks workflow  
/code    # Feature implementation with constraints
/debug   # Systematic problem analysis using UltraThink
/test    # Comprehensive testing strategy
/review  # Multi-dimensional code validation
/optimize # Performance optimization coordination
```

**Progression Example**:
```bash
# Step-by-step development with manual control
/ask "Help me understand microservices architecture requirements"
/spec "Generate API gateway specifications" 
/code "Implement gateway with rate limiting"
/test "Create load testing suite"
/review "Validate security and performance"
```

## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. Setup Configuration

├── agents/           # 7 expert agent configurations  
└── CLAUDE.md         # Project-specific guidelines
```

### 2. Basic Usage

## 📚 Workflow Examples

### Enterprise User Authentication System

**Input**:
```bash
/requirements-pilot "Enterprise JWT authentication with RBAC, supporting 500 concurrent users, integrated with existing LDAP"
```

**Automated Process**:
1. **Requirements Confirmation** (Quality: 92/100) - Interactive clarification
   - Functional clarity, technical specificity, implementation completeness
   - **Decision**: ≥90%, proceed with implementation

2. **Round 1** (Quality: 83/100) - Basic implementation
   - Issues: Error handling incomplete, integration concerns
   - **Decision**: <90%, restart with improvements

3. **Round 2** (Quality: 93/100) - Production ready
   - **Decision**: ≥90%, proceed to functional testing

**Final Deliverables**:
- Requirements confirmation with quality assessment
- Implementation-ready technical specifications
- Pragmatic JWT implementation with RBAC
- LDAP integration with proper error handling
- Functional test suite focusing on critical paths

### API Gateway Development

**Input**:
```bash
/ask "Design considerations for high-performance API gateway"
# (Interactive consultation phase)

/spec "Microservices API gateway with rate limiting and circuit breakers"
# (Specification generation)

/code "Implement gateway based on specifications"
# (Implementation phase)
```

**Results**:
- Architectural consultation on performance patterns
- Detailed specifications with load balancing strategy
- Production-ready implementation with monitoring

## 🔧 Advanced Usage Patterns

### Custom Workflow Composition

```bash
# Debug → Fix → Validate workflow
First use debug to analyze [performance issue], 
then use code to implement fixes, 
then use spec-validation to ensure quality

# Complete development + optimization pipeline  
First use spec-generation for [feature], 
then spec-executor for implementation,
then spec-validation for quality check,
then if score ≥95% use spec-testing,
finally use optimize for production readiness
```

### Quality-Driven Development

```bash
# Iterative quality improvement
First use spec-validation to score [existing code],
then if score <95% use code to improve based on feedback,
repeat until quality threshold achieved
```
